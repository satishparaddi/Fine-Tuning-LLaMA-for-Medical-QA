### Question:
What are the symptoms of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM)?

### Answer:LCMV is most commonly recognized as causing neurological disease, as its name implies, though infection without symptoms or mild febrile illnesses are more common clinical manifestations.

For infected persons who do become ill, onset of symptoms usually occurs 8-13 days after exposure to the virus as part of a biphasic febrile illness. This initial phase, which may last as long as a week, typically begins with any or all of the following symptoms: fever,

### Question:
What are the symptoms of Alkhurma Hemorrhagic Fever (AHF)?

### Answer:Based on limited information, after an incubation period that could be as short as 2-4 days, the disease presents initially with non-specific flu-like symptoms, including fever, anorexia (loss of appetite), general malaise, diarrhea, and vomiting; a second phase has appeared in some patients, and includes neurologic and hemorrhagic symptoms in severe form. Multi-organ failure precedes fatal outcomes. No repeated or chronic symptoms have been reported following recovery. Evidence suggests that

### Question:
what are the signs and symptoms of rabies?

### Answer:The first symptoms of rabies may be very similar to those of the flu including general weakness or discomfort, fever, or headache. These symptoms may last for days.

There may be also discomfort or a prickling or itching sensation at the site of bite, progressing within days to symptoms of cerebral dysfunction, anxiety, confusion, agitation. As the disease progresses, the person may experience delirium, abnormal behavior, hallucinations, and insomnia.

The acute period of disease typically ends after 2 to 10 days.

### Question:
what are the symptoms of botulism?

### Answer:The classic symptoms of botulism include double vision, blurred vision, drooping eyelids, slurred speech, difficulty swallowing, dry mouth, and muscle weakness. Infants with botulism appear lethargic, feed poorly, are constipated, and have a weak cry and poor muscle tone. These are all symptoms of the muscle paralysis caused by the bacterial toxin. If untreated, these symptoms may progress to cause paralysis of the respiratory muscles, arms, legs, and trunk. In foodborne botulism, symptoms generally

No label_names provided for model class `PeftModelForCausalLM`. Since `PeftModel` hides base models input arguments, if label_names is not given, label_names can't be set automatically within `Trainer`. Note that empty label_names list will be used instead.
/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/torch/_dynamo/eval_frame.py:745: UserWarning: torch.utils.checkpoint: the use_reentrant parameter should be passed explicitly. In version 2.5 we will raise an exception if use_reentrant is not passed. use_reentrant=False is recommended, but if you need to preserve the current default behavior, you can pass use_reentrant=True. Refer to docs for more details on the differences between the two variants.

After fine-tuning: What are the signs and symptoms of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM)? The signs and symptoms of Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis (LCM) include fever, headache, and a sore throat. The human herpesvirus 6 virus is the cause of LCM. The virus typically causes a mild and self-limiting illness that resolves on its own. In some cases, the virus can cause a more severe illness called meningitis. Meningitis is a rare complication of LCM that can cause a severe headache, fever, confusion, and changes in vision, hearing, and speech. The human herpesvirus 6 virus is a type of herpesvirus that is also found in other parts of the body besides the brain and eyes. In most people, the virus does not cause any symptoms.
